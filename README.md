# **Smart Home Signal Chain Automation System with Visualizer**

## **Overview**  
This system simulates a smart home environment where appliances are connected and can communicate with each other to trigger chain reactions. The **top-down house visualizer** acts as a virtual substitute for a real home, representing the layout and interactions between devices. Users can monitor, create, and adjust workflows that automate tasks like lighting, temperature control, and more.

## **Features**  

### **1. Workflow Automation**  
- Automate tasks with triggers and actions.  
- Chain reactions between devices for smooth, automated operations.  

### **2. Top-Down House Visualizer**  
- A digital, top-down representation of your home, simulating how devices work and interact.  
- Devices (lights, sensors, appliances) are represented as icons in rooms, allowing users to see how they interact when triggered.  
- The visualizer substitutes real devices and enables monitoring of simulated actions in real time.  

### **3. Node-Based Workflow Editor**  
- Create workflows by defining triggers, actions, delays, and conditions.  
- Easily set up complex automations without programming knowledge.  

### **4. Real-Time Simulation**  
- Visual feedback shows actions like lights turning on, water heating, and other appliances activating based on simulated signals.  
- Track the progress of workflows as they execute and monitor how devices respond in the virtual home environment.

## **How It Works**  

### **1. Virtual Home Setup**  
- Set up a simulated top-down view of your house.  
- Devices like lights, motion sensors, thermostats, and appliances are represented by icons in the corresponding rooms (e.g., living room, kitchen).  

### **2. Create a Workflow**  
- Example: **"Morning Routine"**  
  - **Trigger**: Motion detected by the bedroom sensor.  
  - **Actions**:  
    1. Turn on bedroom lights.  
    2. After 2 minutes, activate the water heater.  
    3. When the water heater is done, start boiling the kettle.  

### **3. Visualize Actions**  
- The virtual house simulates the actions, showing lights turning on, water heating, and other connected devices reacting.  
- Each device sends a signal that triggers the next, and users can see the sequence of actions unfold on the visualizer.

## **Example Workflow in the Visualizer**  

**"Morning Routine"**  
- **Trigger**: A motion sensor detects movement in the bedroom.  
- **Actions**:  
  1. **Lights**: Turn on the bedroom lights.  
  2. **Water Heater**: After 2 minutes, the system sends a signal to the water heater, activating it.  
  3. **Kettle**: Once the water is heated, the system sends a signal to start boiling water in the kettle.  

The visualizer will show the lights turning on, a timer counting down for the water heater, and finally, the kettle activating once the water is ready.

## **Getting Started**  
1. **Set up your simulated home**:  
   - Place appliances and sensors in the virtual rooms of your house.  
2. **Create workflows**:  
   - Define triggers and actions using the node-based editor.  
3. **Monitor the simulation**:  
   - Watch the virtual home react to the workflows as appliances trigger actions in sequence.

## **Future Plans**  
- Integration with real IoT devices (to replace the simulation with actual devices).  
- More advanced scheduling features (e.g., daily routines, energy-saving modes).  
- Predictive automation based on habits and usage patterns.
